**EnzyNet** is a project that uses **3D convolutional neural networks** for **enzyme classification**. This repository contains all of the code that has been used to design, test, and run [EnzyNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06017.pdf "Project's paper"). We tried to make it as user-friendly as possible, so that you can run tests on your own datasets too! If you are interested in the background of this project, you can take a look at [our previous publications](https://stanford.edu/~shervine#publications "Publications").


## Documentation
All installation, running and customization procedures are detailed on the [project's webpage](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/projects/doc-enzynet-package.html "Documentation").
